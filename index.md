**As an Alexander Graham Bell doctoral researcher, I am examining the relation between attention, memory, and awareness** (advisors: <a href="https://www.psych.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/morris-moscovitch" target="_blank">Morris Moscovitch</a> and <a href="https://www.psych.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/claude-alain" target="_blank">Claude Alain</a> at The University of Toronto and Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Hospital).

My present work fascinates me. Using EEG and behavioural measures, I am examining the dynamic interplay between memory and attention and the neural mechanisms that facilitate memory for action. I am also interested in how these effects manifest in congenitally blind individuals. 

My previous BSc work at McGill University in psychoacoustics (timbre & attention) and auditory cognitive neuroscience (neural encoding of music memory & learning) led me to want to know more about the role of real-world sound in memory and attention.
