I have been investigating the dynamic interplay between attention and memory. My present work fascinates me. Using EEG and behavioural measures, we have shown how auditory experience and memory can optimize attention and performance during real-time processing of real-world soundscapes. 

My previous BSc work at McGill University in psychoacoustics (timbre & attention) and auditory cognitive neuroscience (neural encoding of music memory & learning) led me to want to know more about the role of real-world sound in memory and attention.
